# High-level data structures  {#sec-obj}

**Learning objectives**

- Understand the difference between basic data structures and
  high-level objects.
- Understand the concept of high-level object.
- Know how to learn about objects and access data from them.
- Learn about import Bioconductor objects widely used in omics data
  analysis.
- Become familiar with how objects are implemented.

## Introduction

The term *object* stems from the widely used objet-oriented
programming (OOP) paradigm. OOP is however outside of scope of this
course (see part III of @advancedR, which is also [freely available
online](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)). In the *R refresher* chapter
\@ref(sec-refresher), we have seen the base types of R, which we have
efficiently used in many situations. Sometimes, however, these aren't
enough.

We have also use object, for example in chapter \@ref(sec-vis), when
generating ggplot visualisation. We have seen that it is possible to
store the output of `ggplot2` in a variable, that contain all the data
and information necessary to produce the figure.

## Why objects?

- Combine many parts of a complext data, for example store data (and
  possibly different forms thereof (see chapter \@ref(sec-norm)) and
  metadata together.

- Objects are **self describing**: an object to store high-throughput
  sequencing (HTS) data contains high-throughput sequencing
  data. Replace high-throughput sequencing data by DNA sequences (see
  chapter \@ref(sec-biostrings)), proteomics, ... and it will still
  hold.

- Using object enables **consistency**[^flex]: whoever prepares the
  HTS data, it will always have the same structure.

[^flex]: This consistency comes however at the cost of flexibility,
    hence the importance of well designed objects, that fit several
    use cases for the type of data at hand.

- If all information is stored in a single object[^oneobj], it is
  easier to save it, to share it with others, and to use it as an
  input to a function.

[^oneobj]: This idea is consistent with the notion that you would like
    to place all the data relevant to an expriment into a single
    folder.

The above properties lead to greater **robustness** and
**interoperability** when working with objects modelling complex data.

- Common behaviour (methods) can be specialised to match the
  particular data type (this is called **polymorphism**): for example
  plotting (a vector, a matrix, NGS data), summary, subsetting (`[`
  and `[[`), ...

- Another import benefit of using objects to model complex data is
  **abstraction**: it is possible to hide all the (unnecessary for its
  usage) complexity of a particular type of data and present/give
  access to its most imporant parts in a user-friendly **interface**
  and efficient way.

- Relations between object can be recorded (this is called
  **inheritance**).

To avoid confusion, it is useful to define and separate objects and
classes. A **class** describes (models) the general properties for
groups of objects. For example, we could define a class to describe
people in this course as follows:

```
Class person:
- Name: a character
- Surname: a character
- Noma: an optional numeric
- Role: a character (student, teaching assistant, instructor)
```

An **object** is and instantiation of a class with specific values in
its fields:

```
Object of class person:
- Name: Laurent
- Surname: Gatto
- Noma: NA
- Role: instructor
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Write down two objects that would describe a teaching assistant and a
student.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```
Object of class person:
- Name: Axelle
- Surname: Loriot
- Noma: NA
- Role: teaching assistant

Object of class person:
- Name: Alejandra
- Surname: Sanchez-Cortez
- Noma: 123456
- Role: student
```

`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

We will focus on objects and their usage here.

## Examples in base R {#sec-lm}

Let's start by generating a testing dataset composed of two correlated
variables, `x` and `y`:

```{r df, fig.cap = "The `x` and `y` variables display a linear relationship."}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
df <- data.frame(x, y)
head(df)
plot(y ~ x, df)
```

We are now going to model the linear relation between `x` and `y`
using the `lm` (linear model) function. The resulting variable `fit`
is the result of computing the linear regression
$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x + \epsilon$.
When printing the object, we see the call we performed, the
intercept ($\beta_0$) and the slope ($\beta_1$) of the regression.

```{r lm1}
fit <- lm(y ~ x, df)
fit
```

We can plot the linear regression line with `abline` and passing the
`fit` variable.

```{r plotlm, fig.cap = "The regression line modelling the linear regression between the two `x` and `y` variables."}
plot(y ~ x)
abline(fit, col = "red")
```

The `fit` variable is an object of class `lm`, which we can check with
the `class` function.

```{r lmclass}
class(fit)
```

It contains much more than simply the intercept and the slope of the
regression line.


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Find out what an object of class `lm` contains by exploring the
content of the `fit` object (try the `names` and `str` functions) and
reading the `lm` manual page.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Finally, to demonstrate **polymorphism**, let's try to plot the `fit`
variable.

```{r lmplot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7,fig.cap = "Plotting an instance of class `lm` produces a set of diagnostic plots, that inform us about the quality of the regression."}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit)
```

## Examples from the Bioconductor project

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("BiocStyle")
```

We have already briefly seen the [Bioconductor
project](https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM1207/sec-bioinfo.html#sec-bioconductor). It
initiated by Robert Gentleman (@Gentleman:2004;@Huber:2015), one of
the two creators of the R language, and centrally offers dedicated R
packages for bioinformatics.

> Bioconductor provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of
> high-throughput genomic data. Bioconductor uses the R statistical
> programming language, and is open source and open development. It
> has two releases each year, and an active user community.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzY7bPQOXUs) provides a
great overview of the project at large.

Bioconductor provides a rich set of [classes for omics
data](https://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/commonMethodsAndClasses/),
summarised below.

### Common Bioconductor classes

- Rectangular feature x sample data – `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")``::SummarizedExperiment()` (RNAseq count matrix, microarray, ...)
- Genomic coordinates – `r Biocpkg("GenomicRanges")``::GRanges()` (1-based, closed interval)
- DNA / RNA / AA sequences – `r Biocpkg("Biostrings")``::*StringSet()`
- Gene sets – `r Biocpkg("GSEABase")``::GeneSet()` `r Biocpkg("GSEABase")``::GeneSetCollection()`
- Multi-omics data – `r Biocpkg("MultiAssayExperiment")``::MultiAssayExperiment()`
- Single cell data – `r Biocpkg("SingleCellExperiment")``::SingleCellExperiment()`
- Mass spectrometry data – `r Biocpkg("Spectra")``::Spectra()`
- Quantitative proteomics data – `r Biocpkg("QFeatures")``::QFeatures()`

### The `SummarizedExperiment` class

Let's start by installing[^require] the`r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")`
package, that implements the class, and the `r Biocpkg("airway")`
data package, that provides an RNA-Seq example data.

[^require]: Before installing the package, we first check if they are
    available with `require`. If they are missing, the call to
    `require` will return `FALSE`, otherwise it returns `TRUE` and
    loads the packages. Given that we negate the return value of
    `require` using `!`, the packages will be installed only when
    missing.

```{r seinstall, message = FALSE}
if (!require("SummarizedExperiment"))
    BiocManager::install("SummarizedExperiment")
if (!require("airway"))
    BiocManager::install("airway")
```

If you know you have the packages, it is more straightforward to
directly load the packages.

```{r seload, message = FALSE}
library("SummarizedExperiment")
library("airway")
```

The `airway` package provides a data for an RNA-Seq experiment on four
human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethason
published by @Himes:2014. It contains the RNA expression data for
64102 transcripts and 8 samples. These 8 samples correspond to treated
and untreated condition in 4 different cell lines.

Objects if the class `SummarizedExperiment` contain one or more assays
(i.e. sets if quantitative expresson data), each represented by a
matrix-like object (typically) of numeric mode. The rows represent
features such as genes, transcripts, proteins or more generally
genomic ranges and the columns represent samples. The figure below
represents its anatomy in greater details.

```{r sefig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Schematic representation of the anatomy if a `SummarizedExperiment` object. (Figure taken from the `SummarizedExperiment` package vignette.)"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figs/SE.svg")
```

- The sample (columns) metadata can be access with the `colData()`
  function.
- The features (rows) metadata can be access with the `rowData()`
  column.
- If the features represent ranges along genomic coordinates, these
  can be accessed with `rowRanges()`
- Additional metadata describing the overall experiment can be
  accessed with `metadata()`.
- The quantiative data can be accessed with `assay()`.
- `assays()` returns a list of matrix-like assays.


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Load the `airway` data and display it in your R console. Make sure you
understand all parts in the short text summary that is displayed. What
class is `airway` of.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Extract the quantitative assay data, the rows and columns metadata,
the row ranges and the experiment metadata. What are the classes of
these individual parts of the `SummarizedExperiment` object.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r seex1}
data(airway)
airway
class(airway)
assay(airway)
class(assay(airway))
colData(airway)
class(colData(airway))
rowData(airway)
class(rowData(airway))
rowRanges(airway)
class(rowRanges(airway))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

The row and column metadata are stored as a special `data.frame`
implementation[^dfimp], that has been developed in the Bioconductor
project. It behaves like like a classical `data.frame`.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
What biological sample names in the `airway` dataset were treated with
dexamethason?  Which ones weren't?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r seex2a}
dex_treated <- airway$dex == "trt"
## shorthand for colData(airway)$dex == "trt"
## Treated samples
colData(airway)[dex_treated, "BioSample"]
## Control samples
colData(airway)[!dex_treated, "BioSample"]
```

It is also possible to use the `tidyverse` for this by first coercing
the `DataFrame` to a `tibble`.

```{r seex2b}
as_tibble(colData(airway)) %>%
    filter(dex == "trt") %>%
    dplyr::select(BioSample)

as_tibble(colData(airway)) %>%
    filter(dex != "trt") %>%
    dplyr::select(BioSample)
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
What are the dimensions of the assay data, and the row and column
metadata? What can you way about these?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r seex3}
dim(airway)
dim(colData(airway))
dim(rowData(airway))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


[^dfimp]: Like the `tibble`, that is an implememtation specific to the
    `tidyverse` packages.


### Subsetting `SummarizedExperiment` objects

As mentioned in the introduction, it is possible to redefine common
functions to have a special behaviour with objects. This is the case
for the `[` operator, that will automatically subset all parts of the
object. Below, we create a new instance of class
`SummarizedExperiment` that contains only the 5 first features for the
3 first samples.

```{r sesub}
se <- airway[1:5, 1:3]
se
```

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Verfiy that the assay data, the column and row metadata and the row
ranges have been preserved.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

Subsetting can be performed with numberics (as shown above), but also
with characters of logicals, just like with dataframes or matrices.

`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Create a new object that contains the data for features (rows)
`"ENSG00000166963"`, `"ENSG00000267970"` and `"ENSG00000254663"` and
samples (columns) `"SRR1039517"` and `"SRR1039521"`.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r seex4}
airway[c("ENSG00000166963", "ENSG00000267970", "ENSG00000254663"),
       c("SRR1039517", "SRR1039521")]
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`

The row ranges are defined as a list of genomic ranges (`GRanges`
objects), one genomic range per row in the
`SummarizedExperiment`. This `GRangesList` object behaves like a list,
albeit a list that specifically contains `GRanges` objects.

If we look at the first feature, corresponding to gene
`ENSG00000000003`, we see that is is composed of 17 exons
(`ENSE00001459322` to `ENSE00001828996`) and their detailed positions
on chromosome X.

```{r}
rowRanges(airway)[[1]]
```

The position of genes can also be used to subset a
`SummarizedExperiment`. In the example below, we select all features
that overlap with positions 100000 to 1100000 on chromosome 1. To do
this we first create a new `GRanges` object that matches the region of
interest:

```{r roi}
roi <- GRanges(seqnames="1", ranges=100000:1100000)
roi
```

We can now use `roi` to extract the feature of interest with the
`subsetByOverlaps` function, which returns a new
`SummarizedExperiment` object that contains 74 features.

```{r sbo}
se <- subsetByOverlaps(airway, roi)
se
```


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
How many genes are present on chromosome X between position 100000 et 1000000.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`


`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
roi <- GRanges(seqnames = "X", ranges = 1e5:1e6)
nrow(subsetByOverlaps(airway, roi))
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`
Visit the Ensembl page and look up the Ensembl gene identifier
(`ENSG00...`) of the BRCA1 gene. Verify if these match the information
in the `airway` data. If not, why could this be? How many exons are
there in the `airway` data for this gene?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

`r msmbstyle::solution_begin()`
```{r}
gr <- rowRanges(airway["ENSG00000012048", ])
gr
length(gr[[1]])
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`


### Constructing a `SummarizedExperiment`


Complex object such as `SummarizedExperiment` are generally
constructed by functions (called **constructors**) from files. It is
possible to construct a `SummarizedExperiment` by hand. To do so, we
first need to construct the different parts of the object.

Let's create an expression matrix for 200 genes and 6 samples by
randomly sample values between 1 and 10000.

```{r newse1}
nrows <- 200
ncols <- 6
counts <- matrix(runif(nrows * ncols, 1, 1e4), nrows)
```

Below, we create a the `colData` part using the appropriate
constructor for the class of data needed:

```{r newse2}
cd <- DataFrame(Treatment=rep(c("ChIP", "Input"), 3),
                row.names=LETTERS[1:6])
```

Let's also create some ranges. Here, we will have one range per
features, as opposed to the `airway` data, that has multiple ranges
(exons) per feature (gene). The ranges below to chromosomes 1 and 2
(50 and 150 respectively), with ranges (constructure with the
`IRanges` constructor) starting between 1e5 and 1e6 with width 100,
and strand chosing randomly as the positive or negative strand.


```{r newse3}
rng <- GRanges(rep(c("chr1", "chr2"), c(50, 150)),
               IRanges(floor(runif(200, 1e5, 1e6)), width = 100),
               strand = sample(c("+", "-"), 200, TRUE))
```

We can now put the different parts together using the
`SummarizedExperiment` constructor:

```{r newse4}
se <- SummarizedExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts),
                           colData = cd,
                           rowRanges = rng)
se
```


We can also create a `rowData` object and add it to our `se` object:

```{r newse5}
rowData(se) <- DataFrame(some_value = sample(200))
se
```

## Additional exercises


`r msmbstyle::question_begin()`

Using the function `kem2.tsv` from the `rWSBIM1207` package, import
the *count* and *annotation* data into R and use them to create an object
of class `SummarizedExperiment`.
`r msmbstyle::question_end()`

```{r kemse, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("rWSBIM1207")
fls <- rWSBIM1207::kem2.tsv()
counts <- as.matrix(read.delim(fls[1], row.names = "ref"))
cd <- read.delim(fls[2])

library("SummarizedExperiment")
se <- SummarizedExperiment(assays = list(counts = counts),
                           colData = cd)
```
